You really don’t know how happy I am for both of us: I’ll learn how to “teach”, while you’ll learn a coding language that will revolutionize your life, I’m sure of it hahaha We’ll see how to speed up analyses, how to automate them, how to untie ourselves from that cancer that is Excel, how to make beautiful graphs and how to gain time to do other things. First, you need to start with the installation and some basic concepts. Let’s start this beautiful journey! "],["installation.html", "1 Installation", " 1 Installation First of all, we need to install R to be able to use it. To do so, go to this link and follow the instruction for the installation. … Done?! Great, now you can start using R on your pc, directly from your terminal: but since it is an inconvenient and ancient way, let’s take advantage of the potential and functions of RStudio to be true professionals. Go here and download this amazing software. … Done?! Perfect, let’s open it. "],["first-step-in-rstudio.html", "2 First step in RStudio Console", " 2 First step in RStudio Don’t be intimidated by all these windows that you see open, we will slowly dig into them one by one. Console Let’s start from the console, that is the space where we will start writing the first commands and where their outputs are displayed. Let’s try a basic thing right away, using R as a calculator, type 2 + 2 on the console and press enter. 2+2 [1] 4 Easy right? It returns 4. Now you can start playing a bit with the various operations, you can also write long expressions and you will see how the result will be shown immediately. … Ok, but… usually we need the results of some operation to be saved, or often we want to use the same number several times without having to remember it, and this is where the concept of variable comes into play. "],["variables.html", "3 Variables Create a variable Use a variable Variable names Overwriting variables List all variables Delete variables Type of variables Exercises", " 3 Variables As mentioned, we often need some number (eg a concentration), some table (eg table of differentially expressed genes), information (eg the name of a protein) etc. to be saved in R to be able to use them later in the analysis. This is where variables come into play, and now we’ll see how to create them, how to reuse them, and what kinds of variables exist. Create a variable To create a variable we write name_of_the_variable &lt;- what_to_save (you can either use = instead of &lt;-, even if the former is usually used for declaring arguments in a function, but we’ll see it later). Now, write this to the console, click Return/send on the keyborard, and see what happens: myvar &lt;- 5 On the console nothing happens, but something appeared in the window called Environment (if yours is different, it may be that there is the “List” view setting instead of “Grid” in the blue box, you can change it to your liking). Here in details the info given for each variable: Name: name of the variable Type: type of the variable (don’t worry, we’ll see in a minute what this means) Length:: the length of the variable (how many items it contains) Size: how much memory that variable occupies Value: the value of our variable If we want to create multiple variables with the same value we can do this: var1 &lt;- var2 &lt;- var3 &lt;- 20 print(var1) [1] 20 print(var2) [1] 20 print(var3) [1] 20 Use a variable Ok, but once stored, how to we use a variable? Easy, we just need to type it in the console (or start writing the first letters of its name and press Tab to show RStudio suggestions). If, for example, we want to calculate the power of our variable we should write: myvar ** 2 [1] 25 And here is the result (to elevate to the power we can either use ** or ^). And what if we want to store this result? As before: myvar_power &lt;- myvar ** 2 print(myvar_power) [1] 25 Here we use print() function, but in R we can also just write the name of the variable to see it. Variable names As in everything, even in naming variables there are rules and guidelines. Don’t be scared, they are simple and will make your life easier, let’s see them together. Rules: Variable name CANNOT start with a character other than a letter Variable name can contain both letters and numbers (case sensitive, uppercase and lowercase matter) Variable name may contain as special characters only the dot . or the underscore _ Guidelines: Since the name of the variable must be useful, its name must suggest something: for example, the variable myvar was previously defined, whose meaning is equal to 0 (so avoid these names), while myvar_power is more indicative, as it tells us that it is raised to a power Variables are normally written in lowercase letters, except for those you want to remain constant in your analysis, which in other languages are written in uppercase (this does not make them immutable, but suggests this feature within the script) Use underscores rather than periods as special characters in variable names if you can If the variable name contains more than one word, you can separate them with an underscore (as in the example) or use the camel case (myvarPower) or the Pascal case (MyvarPower) Be consistent within the script: if you decide to use the Pascal case, always use the Pascal case in that script Overwriting variables Attention! Variables can be overwritten (unrecoverable action). To override a variable, simply assign that variable a new value: print(myvar) [1] 5 myvar &lt;- 9 print(myvar) [1] 9 Now myvar is equal to 9, and there is no way back… This feature is useful for saving space and not cluttering up too much with variables that are okay to change often, but it can be risky. So be careful when naming variables. List all variables A useful way to avoid overwriting an important variable is to list the variables. We know that in RStudio they are all present in the Environment window, but what if we weren’t in RStudio but elsewhere (for example in the terminal)? The answer is simple, let’s use the ls() function ls() [1] &quot;age_inf_threshold&quot; &quot;age_sup_threshold&quot; &quot;ch1&quot; [4] &quot;ch2&quot; &quot;ch3&quot; &quot;ch4&quot; [7] &quot;ch5&quot; &quot;ch6&quot; &quot;expr&quot; [10] &quot;mother_diabetes&quot; &quot;myvar&quot; &quot;myvar_power&quot; [13] &quot;nationality&quot; &quot;num1&quot; &quot;num2&quot; [16] &quot;patient_age&quot; &quot;patient_state&quot; &quot;patient_weight&quot; [19] &quot;var1&quot; &quot;var2&quot; &quot;var3&quot; [22] &quot;weight_sup_threshold&quot; Here are our variables. Note how I called this command with the name function: we will cover this concept later, for now you just need to know that they exist and that they can be identified immediately by the fact that after the name there is a pair of round brackets. Delete variables To delete a variable, use the rm() function and insert the variable to be deleted: # create a variable to_remove &lt;- 1213 # list all variables ls() [1] &quot;age_inf_threshold&quot; &quot;age_sup_threshold&quot; &quot;ch1&quot; [4] &quot;ch2&quot; &quot;ch3&quot; &quot;ch4&quot; [7] &quot;ch5&quot; &quot;ch6&quot; &quot;expr&quot; [10] &quot;mother_diabetes&quot; &quot;myvar&quot; &quot;myvar_power&quot; [13] &quot;nationality&quot; &quot;num1&quot; &quot;num2&quot; [16] &quot;patient_age&quot; &quot;patient_state&quot; &quot;patient_weight&quot; [19] &quot;to_remove&quot; &quot;var1&quot; &quot;var2&quot; [22] &quot;var3&quot; &quot;weight_sup_threshold&quot; # delete just-created variable rm(to_remove) # list all variables ls() [1] &quot;age_inf_threshold&quot; &quot;age_sup_threshold&quot; &quot;ch1&quot; [4] &quot;ch2&quot; &quot;ch3&quot; &quot;ch4&quot; [7] &quot;ch5&quot; &quot;ch6&quot; &quot;expr&quot; [10] &quot;mother_diabetes&quot; &quot;myvar&quot; &quot;myvar_power&quot; [13] &quot;nationality&quot; &quot;num1&quot; &quot;num2&quot; [16] &quot;patient_age&quot; &quot;patient_state&quot; &quot;patient_weight&quot; [19] &quot;var1&quot; &quot;var2&quot; &quot;var3&quot; [22] &quot;weight_sup_threshold&quot; As we see, in the second case the to_remove variable has been removed. What if I want to remove multiple variables? Let’s put multiple variable names inside the rm() function separated by commas: # create various variables to_remove &lt;- 1213 to_remove2 &lt;- 685 # list all variables ls() [1] &quot;age_inf_threshold&quot; &quot;age_sup_threshold&quot; &quot;ch1&quot; [4] &quot;ch2&quot; &quot;ch3&quot; &quot;ch4&quot; [7] &quot;ch5&quot; &quot;ch6&quot; &quot;expr&quot; [10] &quot;mother_diabetes&quot; &quot;myvar&quot; &quot;myvar_power&quot; [13] &quot;nationality&quot; &quot;num1&quot; &quot;num2&quot; [16] &quot;patient_age&quot; &quot;patient_state&quot; &quot;patient_weight&quot; [19] &quot;to_remove&quot; &quot;to_remove2&quot; &quot;var1&quot; [22] &quot;var2&quot; &quot;var3&quot; &quot;weight_sup_threshold&quot; # delete just-created variables rm(to_remove, to_remove2) # list all variables ls() [1] &quot;age_inf_threshold&quot; &quot;age_sup_threshold&quot; &quot;ch1&quot; [4] &quot;ch2&quot; &quot;ch3&quot; &quot;ch4&quot; [7] &quot;ch5&quot; &quot;ch6&quot; &quot;expr&quot; [10] &quot;mother_diabetes&quot; &quot;myvar&quot; &quot;myvar_power&quot; [13] &quot;nationality&quot; &quot;num1&quot; &quot;num2&quot; [16] &quot;patient_age&quot; &quot;patient_state&quot; &quot;patient_weight&quot; [19] &quot;var1&quot; &quot;var2&quot; &quot;var3&quot; [22] &quot;weight_sup_threshold&quot; The two variables have been removed. But looking closely at these codes, we see that some start with # and are not evaluated. What are they? These are the comments, i.e. messages that you will write in the scripts (and we will see later how to create them) to help you understand what you are doing. They are actual comments that you can add, and will not be “evaluated” as code as the line starts with #. Type of variables So far so linear, right? Great, it will continue to be as easy 🙃. Let’s see what are the basic types of variables that exist in R: Numeric: numbers, can be integer (whole numbers) or double (decimal numbers) Character: characters, therefore strings of letters (words, sentences, etc.) Boolean: TRUE or FALSE, are a special type of variable that R interprets in its own way, but super super super useful Factor: similar to character, but with peculiar features (and memory saving), often used for categorical variables such as male/female, heterozygous/wild-type We will see each type of variable in detail in next chapters. To find out what type a variable is we use the typeof() function: typeof(myvar) [1] &quot;double&quot; We see that myvar is a double (although it is an integer value), this is because R basically interprets every number as a double, so as to increase its precision and the possibility of operations between various numbers without having type problems. Exercises Ok, this chapter was long enough, let’s do some exercises to fix well these concepts. Exercise 3.1 Create 3 variables indicating the weights of 3 mice. Solution mice1 &lt;- 5.8 mice2 &lt;- 4.8 mice3 &lt;- 7.5 print(mice1) [1] 5.8 print(mice2) [1] 4.8 print(mice3) [1] 7.5 Exercise 3.2 Create the variable sum_weights as the sum of the weights of those 3 mice. Solution sum_weights &lt;- mice1 + mice2 + mice3 print(sum_weights) [1] 18.1 Exercise 3.3 Create 4 other variables for other 4 mice that weight 20 g. Then you realize you did a mistake and you choose to delete 3 of them and change the fourth to 7.7. Solution # create 4 variables mice4 &lt;- mice5 &lt;- mice6 &lt;- mice7 &lt;- 20 # list all variables ls() [1] &quot;age_inf_threshold&quot; &quot;age_sup_threshold&quot; &quot;ch1&quot; [4] &quot;ch2&quot; &quot;ch3&quot; &quot;ch4&quot; [7] &quot;ch5&quot; &quot;ch6&quot; &quot;expr&quot; [10] &quot;mice1&quot; &quot;mice2&quot; &quot;mice3&quot; [13] &quot;mice4&quot; &quot;mice5&quot; &quot;mice6&quot; [16] &quot;mice7&quot; &quot;mother_diabetes&quot; &quot;myvar&quot; [19] &quot;myvar_power&quot; &quot;nationality&quot; &quot;num1&quot; [22] &quot;num2&quot; &quot;patient_age&quot; &quot;patient_state&quot; [25] &quot;patient_weight&quot; &quot;sum_weights&quot; &quot;var1&quot; [28] &quot;var2&quot; &quot;var3&quot; &quot;weight_sup_threshold&quot; # delete 3 of the just-created variables rm(mice5, mice6, mice7) # list all variables ls() [1] &quot;age_inf_threshold&quot; &quot;age_sup_threshold&quot; &quot;ch1&quot; [4] &quot;ch2&quot; &quot;ch3&quot; &quot;ch4&quot; [7] &quot;ch5&quot; &quot;ch6&quot; &quot;expr&quot; [10] &quot;mice1&quot; &quot;mice2&quot; &quot;mice3&quot; [13] &quot;mice4&quot; &quot;mother_diabetes&quot; &quot;myvar&quot; [16] &quot;myvar_power&quot; &quot;nationality&quot; &quot;num1&quot; [19] &quot;num2&quot; &quot;patient_age&quot; &quot;patient_state&quot; [22] &quot;patient_weight&quot; &quot;sum_weights&quot; &quot;var1&quot; [25] &quot;var2&quot; &quot;var3&quot; &quot;weight_sup_threshold&quot; # change the value of one variable mice4 &lt;- 7.7 print(mice4) [1] 7.7 Alright, if you have done all the exercises (and I’m sure you have), we can move on to the next chapter in which we briefly talk about scripts and saving the environment. "],["scripts.html", "4 Scripts Save Source a script", " 4 Scripts Ok, let’s take a break before all the theoretical chapters to discuss about scripts. I always say this word when talking to you about my job, but what are they? A script is essentially an ordered list of commands, used to not have to write again and again the same commands on the console. It can contain everything you type in the console, like functions, operations and even comments; in this way, you can do an analysis and store it as a “text” file that you can use as reference (so you know what you have done), use for another analysis, edit, share with others… You will always write code in scripts, for all these reasons. Let’s see how to create a script, write some code in it and run part of the script or even a small part of it in RStudio. In the video we see a series of actions: To create a script, click the button on top left, then select “R Script” (or File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script) Start writing the commands (even comments) To run a single line click “Run” To run the whole script (R starts from the beginning) click “Source”) Suggetion: Comment, comment, comment everything. I know it is time consuming, but you will be so happy and greatful to read comments that help you understand what you’ve done months (or weeks) before. Save To save a script “File -&gt; Save” or the usual shortcut “Ctrl-S” (Windows) or “Cmd-S” (MacOS). Use them for all the exercise from now on! Source a script Source a script from the console instead of having to open it and source from RStudio is very useful when you want to save time and create re-usable pipelines or analysis. Sourcing a script means to execute all the line of codes in that script. It can be archieved by doing source(\"path_to_file\"). Now, head to the next chapter in which we will talk about numbers. "],["numbers.html", "5 Numbers Operations Rounding Tranform to type number Exercises", " 5 Numbers I know you know what numbers are, and we’ve already seen that we have two types of numbers in R: integers and doubles; so, let’s move to see them in action. Operations First of all, here is how to do basic mathematical operation in R: # Plus, minus, multiply, divide 5 + 4 - 2 * 3 / 2 [1] 6 # Power 4 ** 3 [1] 64 # Logarithm log(100) # base e [1] 4.60517 log10(100) # base 10 [1] 2 log2(100) # base 2 [1] 6.643856 log(100, base = 3) # choose the base [1] 4.191807 # Natural exponential exp(2) [1] 7.389056 # Square root sqrt(9) [1] 3 An interesting operator is the modulus (%%) which returns the remainder of a division, for example: 7 %% 3 [1] 1 This can be useful to evaluate if a number is even or odd by calculating the remainder of the division x / 2 (so using x %% 2): if it is 0, the number x is even, otherwise it is odd. 11 %% 2 [1] 1 12 %% 2 [1] 0 Rounding Another thing that we usually want to do is to round decimal number, especially after log transformation or division. To do so, we have 3 functions: # Round to n decimal places round(x = 1/3, digits = 2) [1] 0.33 # Round to upper integer ceiling(10.2) [1] 11 # Round to lower integer floor(14.9) [1] 14 Look how ceiling and floor do not take into account the decimal part, even if it is greater or lower than 0.5. Tranform to type number Sometimes you want to transform a string that contains a number to a numeric type in R. I know we haven’t covered strings yet (next chapter will be on them), but let’s do a bit step forward now just to see this super useful function, that we use a lot when dealing with dataframes. To do so, we’ll use the function called as.numeric() mystring &lt;- &quot;15&quot; # This is a character, can you guess why R interpret it as a character? typeof(mystring) [1] &quot;character&quot; mynumber &lt;- as.numeric(mystring) typeof(mynumber) [1] &quot;double&quot; Wow, you will find this super super super useful. Exercises Let’s now put in practice what we have seen in this chapter and in the previous (remember? the script… I want you to write a script with these exercises and save it) Exercise 5.1 The results of a Real-Time PCR indicate that your triplicates for FOXP1 have these Ct: 22.4, 22.31, 22.24. Calculate the mean value and print it rounded to 2 decimal places. Solution # calculator solution mean_result_calc &lt;- (22.4 + 22.31 + 22.24) / 3 mean_result_calc &lt;- round(mean_result_calc, digits = 2) print(mean_result_calc) [1] 22.32 # BETTER solution rep1 &lt;- 22.4 rep2 &lt;- 22.31 rep3 &lt;- 22.24 n_rep &lt;- 3 mean_res_better &lt;- (rep1 + rep2 + rep3) / n_rep mean_res_better_round &lt;- round(mean_res_better, digits = 2) print(mean_res_better_round) [1] 22.32 The second solution is better because every number is stored in a variable, that you then use to calculate the mean value. Exercise 5.2 Now calculate the sd of the data of exercise 5.1 and print the value rounded to upper integer, to lower integer and to a 4-digit decimal. Solution # Use only better solution, first calculate the variance var_calc &lt;- ((rep1 - mean_res_better)^2 + (rep2 - mean_res_better)^2 + (rep3 - mean_res_better)^2) / (n_rep - 1) # Now let&#39;s calculate sd sd_calc &lt;- sqrt(var_calc) sd_calc_ceil &lt;- ceiling(sd_calc) print(sd_calc_ceil) [1] 1 sd_calc_floor &lt;- floor(sd_calc) print(sd_calc_floor) [1] 0 sd_calc_round &lt;- round(sd_calc, digits = 4) print(sd_calc_round) [1] 0.0802 Ok, now you’re ready to learn about strings, let’s go. "],["character.html", "6 Character Concatenate strings Substring Substitution Grep Transform to type character Exercises", " 6 Character When you analyze a dataset, you don’t have only numbers: you’ll have gene names, protein names, mouse strains and other variables that R calls character (I will alsways call them strings, but remember that for R they are character). A character can be a single letter, a word or even a whole text. To create a character variable you have to include it in \"\" (double quotes) or in ''(single quotes): mychar_d &lt;- &quot;SEC24C&quot; typeof(mychar_d) [1] &quot;character&quot; mychar_s &lt;- &#39;SEC24C&#39; typeof(mychar_s) [1] &quot;character&quot; Even numbers can be considered as character if included by ““: weight_n &lt;- 12 typeof(weight_n) [1] &quot;double&quot; weight_c &lt;- &quot;12&quot; typeof(weight_c) [1] &quot;character&quot; See? Just adding the double/single quotes it changes everything. IMPORTANT: R interprets everything that is between a pair of single/double quotes as character, so if you forget to close a quote, nothing will work. Moreover, you can’t use a single quote to close a character opened with a double quote and vice versa. Concatenate strings Sometimes you want to concatenate different string into one single string, and we can to it with two similar functions: paste() and paste0(). The unique difference among them is that in the former you can decide what character to use to separate what you are concatenating (default is a white space), while the latter do not insert any character. For example, let’s say you have a variable condition and a variable treatment, and you want to concatenate them to create the variable sample; you will do: condition &lt;- &quot;control&quot; treatment &lt;- &quot;vector&quot; sample &lt;- paste(condition, treatment, sep = &quot;.&quot;) # default is &quot; &quot; print(sample) [1] &quot;control.vector&quot; sample0 &lt;- paste0(condition, treatment) print(sample0) [1] &quot;controlvector&quot; You concatenate as many character as you want, just put them all inside that function. Substring I have to tell you about substring, but I never used this function in my life. It is used to slice the character and take only a part of it. The function is called substr(), let’s see how it works: substr(mychar_s, start = 2, stop = 4) [1] &quot;EC2&quot; It needs a start and a stop value, they are both included in the result (in this case, character at position 2, 3 and 4 are sliced). Remember: in R everything starts at 1, so the first element is at position 1. In other languages it starts from 0, but in R it starts from 1. Extra funtcion never used but that can be important if we use substr and we don’t know how long is a character is nchar() nchar(mychar_s) [1] 6 Let’s say we want to take from position 3 until the end, but we don’t know how long is a character, we can do it with: substr(mychar_s, start = 3, stop = nchar(mychar_s)) [1] &quot;C24C&quot; What happened here is that the result of the function nchar(mychar_s) is used as the value to indicate the stop. We will usually use these method in R, especially when we don’t want to use memory to store a value that is used only once (as in this case). Substitution Alright, let’s move to something way more useful for our analysis: the function sub(), and its big brother gsub(). They are used to substitute part of a character with another, the only difference is that the former changes only the first occurrence, while the latter every occurrence. Let’s say we have the sample variable written as \"control_vector_3\" and we want to get rid of the underscores, we will do: sample2 &lt;- &quot;control_variable_2&quot; sub_only &lt;- sub(pattern = &quot;_&quot;, # the part of the string to search to substitute replacement = &quot; &quot;, # what to use to replace it x = sample2) # variable in which to search print(sub_only) [1] &quot;control variable_2&quot; gsub_all &lt;- gsub(pattern = &quot;_&quot;, # the part of the string to search to substitute replacement = &quot; &quot;, # what to use to replace it x = sample2) # variable in which to search print(gsub_all) [1] &quot;control variable 2&quot; This is the basic way of using these functions, but they can be very useful in complex analysis, but we will see them later on. Grep Further parents of substitution, are grep() and its brother grepl(): they are used to check if a particular pattern is present in a character variable. The first one returns the index (we’ll see this concept in few chapters) or the value of the variable that match the pattern, the second one returns a boolean value (TRUE or FALSE) indicatung the presence of the pattern in the variable. Let’s see few example right away: gene_to_test &lt;- &quot;GAPDH&quot; pattern_to_check_1 &lt;- &quot;GA&quot; pattern_to_check_2 &lt;- &quot;PH&quot; grep_1 &lt;- grep(pattern = pattern_to_check_1, x = gene_to_test, value = T) # default is FALSE (returns index) print(grep_1) [1] &quot;GAPDH&quot; grep_2 &lt;- grep(pattern = pattern_to_check_2, x = gene_to_test, value = T) # default is FALSE (returns index) print(grep_2) character(0) grepl_1 &lt;- grepl(pattern = pattern_to_check_1, x = gene_to_test) print(grepl_1) [1] TRUE grepl_2 &lt;- grepl(pattern = pattern_to_check_2, x = gene_to_test) print(grepl_2) [1] FALSE We can see that the grep_2 gives character(0) as result, meaning that it is an empty character variable. You are going to use grep a lot during the analysis, even if you find it not so interesting now, trust me 😉. Transform to type character As for numbers, we can also convert a variable into a string: we use the function as.character(). You will use this function when a column of a dataframe is read as numeric while you want it to be read as character instead. ml_to_add &lt;- 35 typeof(ml_to_add) [1] &quot;double&quot; ml_to_add &lt;- as.character(ml_to_add) typeof(ml_to_add) [1] &quot;character&quot; This is an important lesson: in R variables can be overwritten with other types of data (this can’t be done in other languages such as Java, C++, ecc.). This can be both handy and risky at the same time: handy because we can save memory by overwriting useless variables, risky because we can overwrite a variable without checking if the type is maintained (maybe it is important). Exercises Exercise 5.2 In a list of genes to test, you found a gene called “NRG_1” and one called “SST R”. In the report you have to present you want to print out “Involved genes are NRG1 and SSTR2”. How to do it? Solution gene1 &lt;- &quot;NRG_1&quot; gene2 &lt;- &quot;SST R&quot; # correct gene names gene1 &lt;- gsub(pattern = &quot;_&quot;, replacement = &quot;&quot;, gene1) gene2 &lt;- gsub(pattern = &quot; R&quot;, replacement = &quot; R2&quot;, gene1) # concatenate all the string all_string &lt;- paste(&quot;Involved genes are&quot;, gene1, &quot;and&quot;, gene2) print(all_string) [1] &quot;Involved genes are NRG1 and NRG1&quot; Exercise 5.2 In a variable you have the gene name “HCN1” and in another you have its number of aa (890, as numeric!!!). Print out the string “HCN1 protein is 890 aa long” Solution gene &lt;- &quot;HCN1&quot; aa_num &lt;- 890 # one string solution to_print &lt;- paste(gene, &quot;protein is&quot;, as.character(aa_num), &quot;aa long&quot;) print(to_print) [1] &quot;HCN1 protein is 890 aa long&quot; Don’t worry if you had done it in another way or if it didn’t work. We are here to learn, and these exercises are done to challenge you on things you have seen in different pieces. Head on to the next lesson, in which we are going to talk about booleans. "],["boolean.html", "7 Boolean Boolean as results of comparison Logical operator Exercises", " 7 Boolean We finally arrived to the last data type that needs a deeper explanation: the boolean (or logical). In programming languages, there are a particular type of data (the boolean) representing what we can imagine as true or false, in R they are represented by two values: TRUE (or T) and FALSE (or F). We can see an example here: t_value &lt;- TRUE f_value &lt;- FALSE typeof(t_value) [1] &quot;logical&quot; typeof(f_value) [1] &quot;logical&quot; R calls them logical (as in computer science). They cannot be explained well if not contextualized, so let’s see some basic practical application here, and be patient, in next lessons we will see another examples. Boolean as results of comparison The most used way to get a logical is to evaluate a comparison, such as compare numbers, compare words ecc. Quickly, for numbers: num1 &lt;- 3 num2 &lt;- 4 # greater than num1 &gt; num2 [1] FALSE # greater equal than num1 &gt;= num2 [1] FALSE # less than num1 &lt; num2 [1] TRUE # less equal than num1 &lt;= num2 [1] TRUE # equality num1 == num2 [1] FALSE # not equal to num1 != num2 [1] TRUE IMPORTANT: I hope you notice that we used == to identity comparison. And I hope you get why we didn’t use only =. If you don’t, remember that one equal sign assign a value to a variable, so in this case you would have overwritten num1 with the value of num2. And what about character? They behave in this way: # define some variables ch1 &lt;- &quot;Mapk13&quot; ch2 &lt;- &quot;MAPK13&quot; ch3 &lt;- &quot;Xist&quot; # Greater than ch1 &gt; ch2 [1] FALSE ch3 &gt; ch1 [1] TRUE &lt; and &gt; with character, contrary to popular belief, do not take into account the number of characters of the string, but the comparison is based on alphabetical order, with lowercase letters that come prior uppercase ones (that’s why Mapk13 is not greater than MAPK13 and Xist). For this reason, two characters are equal only if they have the same letter/number/special character, in the same order and in the same case. For example: ch4 &lt;- &quot;Peg3&quot; ch5 &lt;- &quot;Peg3&quot; ch6 &lt;- &quot;peg3&quot; ch4 == ch5 [1] TRUE ch5 == ch6 [1] FALSE Logical operator Up to now, we have seen logical as a result of comparisons, but what if we want to compare or combine comparisons? I know it sounds silly, but here is an example of implementation of this concept. We will have to do with dataframes, vectors, matrix and other stuff, and we will always filter for some conditions: let’s say that we want to extrapolate data that are below 10 but above 5. These are two comparisons: x &lt; 10 and x &gt; 5. Here we combine two logicals, derived from the two comparisons. The main logical operators, the one that will be useful for us, are AND, OR and NOT AND The AND operator works as follows: TRUE and TRUE = TRUE TRUE and FALSE = FALSE FALSE and TRUE = FALSE FALSE and FALSE = TRUE An easy trick to remember is: if they are identical (both FALSE or TRUE), the result is TRUE, otherwise is FALSE. In R, AND operator is the &amp;, some examples: expr &lt;- 50 (expr &lt; 60) &amp; (expr &gt; 40) # TRUE &amp; TRUE [1] TRUE (expr &lt; 60) &amp; (expr &lt; 40) # TRUE &amp; FALSE [1] FALSE OR The OR operator works as follows: TRUE and TRUE = TRUE TRUE and FALSE = TRUE FALSE and TRUE = TRUE FALSE and FALSE = FALSE An easy trick to remember is: if at least one is TRUE, then the result is TRUE, otherwise if are all FALSE, the result is FALSE. In R, AND operator is the |, some examples: expr &lt;- 50 (expr &lt; 60) | (expr &gt; 40) # TRUE | TRUE [1] TRUE (expr &lt; 60)| (expr &lt; 40) # TRUE | FALSE [1] TRUE NOT The not operator is used to negate an expression, we have seen an example before, when we compared to numbers to see if they were not equal (!=). It is used before the expression to evaluate, in this form: expr &lt;- 50 !(expr &lt; 60) | (expr &lt; 40) # NOT TRUE | FALSE [1] FALSE !((expr &lt; 60) &amp; (expr &lt; 40)) # NOT (TRUE &amp; FALSE) [1] TRUE Here we see two important things: The not operator must be put before a parenthesis (if it contains a comparison) or directly before a TRUE or FALSE variable As for mathematical expressions, order and parenthesis matters: parenthesis and then from left to right Exercises Write a R script with the following exercises, they are level pro (I know you can): Exercise 7.1 Write the expression you would use to evaluate the following statement: we want to see if the patient is in his childhood (2-8 years) and one of its weight is less than 45 kg (as threshold variable) or if its mother has diabetes (we know it is true), and if its nationality is not USA. Tip: here we have 8 variables. I know I didn’t give neither the age nor the weight nor the nationality; you can create these variables and give the values you want. This exercise is to practice the writing and logical part. Solution # create patient variables patient_age &lt;- 5 patient_weight &lt;- 66 mother_diabetes &lt;- TRUE patient_state &lt;- &quot;Italy&quot; # set thresholds and values age_inf_threshold &lt;- 2 age_sup_threshold &lt;- 8 weight_sup_threshold &lt;- 45 nationality &lt;- &quot;USA&quot; ((patient_age &gt; age_inf_threshold &amp; patient_age &lt; age_sup_threshold) | (patient_weight &lt; weight_sup_threshold | mother_diabetes)) &amp; (patient_state != nationality) [1] TRUE It is best practice to use more parenthesis to help the readability by both human and R Ok, next chapter will be on vectors, and we will do another big step towards practical applications and exercise, with real biological questions.
