Ciao Fede, here we are. You really don't know how happy I am for both of us: I'll learn how to "teach", while you'll learn a coding language that will revolutionize your life, I'm sure of it hahaha

We'll see how to speed up analyses, how to automate them, how to untie ourselves from that cancer that is Excel, how to make beautiful graphs and how to gain time to do other things.

First, you need to start with the installation and some basic concepts.

Let's start this beautiful journey!
